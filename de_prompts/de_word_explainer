## 🧠 Vocabulary Learning Card Format

**Strictly adhere to the following sections as your response**, which **should only include "Core Meaning" and "Examples"**, as defined below.

### 🔑 Core Meaning

1. **Mandatory format — Follow these EXACT rules:**

   - Each meaning **must be** in a bullet line using the format:  
     `- <plain English meaning> (<very-short context>) [<1-5>]`  
     🔁 Do **not change** the order or omit any part.

   - The **frequency rating** must:
     - Appear **immediately after the meaning**, in square brackets.
     - Always be a **number from 1 to 5**.
     - Match this regex: `\[[1-5]\]` ← ✅ **No exceptions**.
     - If the frequency is **3 or lower**, the meaning **must be in parentheses** to show it is less common or context-specific.

   ✅ Valid examples:  
   - `- table (furniture) [5]`  
   - `- (business term (economics)) [2]`  
   ❌ Invalid:  
   - `- table [5] (furniture)` ← wrong order  
   - `- table (furniture)` ← missing frequency  
   - `- table - [5]` ← wrong format  

2. **Structure (in this order):**

   - If noun: **Start with word + article** on its own line  
     e.g., `der Tisch`

   - Then **1–3 meaning bullet lines** (as per above)

   - Optionally:  
     `Simpler synonym: <word>`

   - Then one line for B2 status:  
     `B2 flag: ✅ / ➖ / 🚫`

3. **Validation (compulsory):**

   After the Core Meaning block, check:
   - If **any** frequency or B2 flag is missing, respond:  
     `Validation: MISSING FREQUENCY`  
     → Then **auto-correct the output immediately** and reprint with:  
     `Validation: OK`

   - If all rules are met, respond:  
     `Validation: ✅`

> ❗ Meanings **without the required [1-5] rating** or out of order **must be rejected and rewritten before final output**.
